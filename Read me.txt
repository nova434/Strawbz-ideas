# Open Mindspace – Idea Archive

Welcome to my public idea repository. This space is where I jot down raw thoughts, future plans, experimental concepts, and everything in between. Some of these may evolve into projects, others may remain just sparks—but they’re all part of the process.

## Structure

Each idea is stored as a Markdown file in the `/ideas` directory. Files are numbered sequentially for reference (e.g., `001-first-idea.md`, `002-next-idea.md`).

## Purpose

- To keep a traceable record of ideas over time  
- To reflect on patterns and themes in my thinking  
- To make collaboration possible in the future, if the right people come along  

## Notes

- All content here is **read-only** for now  
- You're welcome to browse, get inspired, and reach out if anything resonates  
- Feedback is welcome but not required—I'm just building in public

## Contact

If you're curious, inspired, or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out via GitHub or any linked contact in the idea files.

**Everything starts as a thought. This is where I keep mine.**
